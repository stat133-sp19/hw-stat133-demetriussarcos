Cooking Recipe: *Blueberry Crumb Bars*
--------------------------------------

#### Description

This particluar Blueberry Crumb Bar recipe was adapted from another recipe posted on [AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10462/blueberry-crumb-bars/). Variations include swapping shortening for butter, substituting the blueberries for other fruit or berries (cranberries, sour cherries, etc.), and removing or adding juices (lemon juice, orange juice, etc.). This scrumptious, easy-to-make dessert can be served year round.

#### Ingredients

##### Crumbs

-   1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   3 cups (390 grams) all-purpose flour
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   Zest of one lemon
-   1 cup (8 ounces or 225 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
-   1 large egg

##### Berries

-   Juice of 1 lemon
-   1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
-   4 teaspoons cornstarch
-   4 cups fresh blueberries

#### Special Kitchen Tools

-   Pastry Cutter (optional)

#### Steps

1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and grease a 9 x 13 in. pan.
2.  In a medium bowl, stir the sugar, flour, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest from the ***crumbs*** portion of the ingredients list. Then use the pastry cutter or fork to mix in the egg and butter. Pat half of the dough into the prepared pan.
3.  In a separate bowl, blend the sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice from the ***berries*** portion of the ingredients list. Mix in the blueberries and then sprinkle the mixture evenly over the crust. Crumble remaining dough over the berry layer.
4.  Bake in heated oven for 45 minutes, or until top is slighty brown. Cool completely before cutting into squares

Euclidean Distance
------------------

**Definition** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\overline{pq}$). In Cartesian Coordinates, if **p** =(*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** =(*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are the two points in Euclidean n-space, then the the distance (d) **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula.

$$
\\begin{equation}
d\\mathbf{(p,q)} = d\\mathbf{(q,p)} = \\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2 + (q\_2-p\_2)^2 + ... + (q\_n-p\_n)^2} \\\\
                = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}
\\end{equation}
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$
\\begin{equation}
\\left\\|{\\mathbf{p}} \\right\\| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 +p\_2^2 + ... + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p \\cdot p}},
\\end{equation}
$$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
