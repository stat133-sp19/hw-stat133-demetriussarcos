```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

where:

* n is the number of (fixed) trials (n ≥ 0)
* p is the probability of success on each trial (0 ≤ p ≤ 1)
* 1 − p is the probability of failure on each trial
* k is a variable that represents the number of successes out of n trials (0 ≤ k ≤ n)
* the first term in parenthesis is NOT a fraction, it is the number of combinations in
which k success can occur in n trials
