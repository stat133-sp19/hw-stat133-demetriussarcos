This document introduces users to the `binomial` package, an R package containing several functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

## Binomial Distribution

The Binomial distribution is perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete
random variables with the following form:

\[
\begin{equation}
\ Pr(X=k) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
\end{equation}
\]

where:

* n is the number of (fixed) trials (n ≥ 0)
* p is the probability of success on each trial (0 ≤ p ≤ 1)
* 1 − p is the probability of failure on each trial
* k is a variable that represents the number of successes out of n trials (0 ≤ k ≤ n)
* the first term in parenthesis is NOT a fraction, it is the number of combinations in
which k success can occur in n trials

The `binomial` package takes these three arguments:
1. trials (the number of trials)
2. success (the number of successes)
3. prob (the probability of success)

and allows users to compute various statistical measures, tables, etc.

## Computing Sample Binomial Probability

First we begin by calculating the binomial probability using with some user defined parameters and the `bin_probability()` function. The `bin_probability` function invokes another of `binomial`'s functions, `bin_choose()`, which computes the binomial combinations given the number of trials and successes. For example,

```{r}
# number of trials
n <- 10
# number of successes
k <- 4
# probability of success
p <- 0.6

sample_prob <- bin_probability(trials = n, success = k, prob = p)
sample_prob
```

## Displaying Binomial Probability
#### Data Table

The `binomial` package provides another function `bin_distribution` that displays binomial probabilities for different number of sucesses in a data frame. The generated has is structured so the number of successes are in the first column and the corresponding probabilities are in the second column.

```{r}
tbl <- bin_distribution(n, p)
tbl
```

#### Plotting Binomial Probabilities

This package provides a plotting method for objects created using the `bin_distribution()` function using R's base plot function. The `plot.bindis()` method generates a barplot of the binomial probabilities for different numbers of success.

```{r}
plot(tbl)
```

#### Cumulative Binomial Probabilities

Another function `binomial` provides is the `bin_cumulative()` function which, like the `bin_distribution()` function, creates a data table that also includes the cumulative binomial probabilities over the number of successes.

```{r}
tbl2 <- bin_cumulative(n,p)
tbl2
```

#### Plotting Cumulative Binomial Probabilities

`binomial` also provides a plotting method for objects created using `bin_cumulative` that generates a line graph of the cumulative binomial probabilities over the number of successes.

```{r}
plot(tbl2)
```

## Creating Binomial Variables

`binomial` also provides the function `bin_variable` which allows users to create binomial random variables that list the number of trials and the probability of success. `bin_variable()` has its own summary method that allows you to display the summary measures of the binomial variable in list like format.

#### Plotting Binomial Variables

```{r}
v <- bin_variable(n, p)
summary(v)
```
